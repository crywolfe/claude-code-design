# Doctor

Cold-start health check. Never installs anything itself — it prints the commands for the user to run. Safe to run multiple times.

## Phase 0 — Managed settings check

This plugin's own `settings.json` (if it shipped one) cannot carry a `permissions.deny` list —
a plugin's settings file only honors the `agent` and `subagentStatusLine` keys. The only mechanism
that can deliver a project-wide deny list alongside a plugin is a **managed settings** file the
client machine's administrator deploys outside this repo entirely, at one of:

- macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
- Linux: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`

Without one of those in place, the PreToolUse hooks in this plugin (`guard-bash.sh`, `guard-browser.py`)
are still the *only* enforced control — there is no separate deny-list layer underneath them the way
the `.claude/settings.json`-based workspace mode has. That is a materially weaker security posture for
anything sensitive, so doctor checks for it and warns (never blocks — doctor is diagnostic, not
enforcement):

1. On macOS: `Bash(test -f "/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json" && echo present || echo missing)`. Linux/Windows administrators should check their own path from the list above; doctor only knows how to check the macOS path directly from here.

   **Deviation from a literal `ls`-based check:** the natural-looking form
   `Bash(ls "/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json" 2>/dev/null)` looks safer
   but is actually denied by this plugin's own bash guard — an absolute path outside the project always
   hits the guard's outside-project deny, regardless of read vs. write intent. `test -f` is one of the
   handful of commands the guard deliberately leaves path-unchecked (alongside `file`, `realpath`,
   `basename`, `unzip`), specifically so existence checks like this one remain possible. Use `test`, not
   `ls`, for this check and for the `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"` checks in Phase 1 below.

2. If missing, warn (do not block):
   > No managed-settings.json found at the standard macOS path. Without it, this plugin's Bash/browser
   > guards are your only layer of defense — there is no separate, admin-deployed deny list under them.
   > Ask your Claude Code administrator to deploy `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/managed-settings.reference.json`
   > (or an equivalent) to the managed-settings path for your OS before relying on this plugin for
   > anything security-sensitive.

## Phase 1 — Inventory

Run in parallel where possible:

1. `Bash(claude mcp list)` — parse output, look for `chrome-devtools: ✓ Connected`
2. `Bash(which monolith)` — existence check
3. `Bash(node --version)` — required (`which node` is blocked by the guard; `node --version` is the allowed form and prints the version for the report)
4. `Bash(which gh)` — for `/ingest-github`
5. `Bash(ls package.json)` — prints the name when it exists, an error when it does not
6. `Bash(test -d "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/starters" && echo present || echo missing)` — this plugin's own starters, not a project-relative path
7. `Bash(ls -d artifacts)`
8. This plugin ships a fixed set of skills installed alongside the plugin itself, so report the
   plugin's version (from its manifest) rather than a live directory count. **Deviation:** the
   analogous workspace-mode check (`ls .claude/skills`) does not carry over — `ls`/`cat`-style reads of
   any `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"` path are denied by this plugin's guard by design (only `node` on the
   three export scripts and `cp` reading a `.js`/`.jsx` starter are allowed), so there is no guard-safe
   way to enumerate `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/skills` from a Bash command here. Do not invent a new guard
   exception for this — it is not worth widening the allowlist for a cosmetic count.
9. `Bash(ls -d node_modules/puppeteer)` and `Bash(ls -d node_modules/pptxgenjs)` — the path printed means installed; `No such file or directory` means missing
10. `Bash(test -n "$FIGMA_TOKEN" && echo FIGMA_TOKEN-present)` — prints `FIGMA_TOKEN-present` when set, exits 1 with no output when not. This form never prints the value; the guard blocks `echo $FIGMA_TOKEN`

Use `ls`, not `test`, for every existence check inside the project (a failing `test -d` prints nothing
and its non-zero exit code is not shown in the tool result, so a missing dependency reads as a pass).
The two exceptions are paths the guard denies to `ls` outright regardless of intent — anything under
`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"` and any absolute path outside the project (as used for the managed-settings
check in Phase 0) — where `test` is used deliberately, per the deviations noted above.

## Phase 2 — Report

Print structured report:

```
Chrome DevTools MCP:   ✓ / ✗ (if ✗, show install command)
monolith CLI:          ✓ / ✗ (optional; needed for /export-standalone)
Node:                  ✓ / ✗ (required)
gh CLI:                ✓ / ✗ (needed for /ingest-github)
puppeteer:             ✓ / ✗ (needed for /export-pdf and /export-pptx)
pptxgenjs:             ✓ / ✗ (needed for /export-pptx)
package.json:          exists / missing
plugin starters/ dir:  exists / missing
artifacts/ dir:        will create
plugin skills:         v<plugin.json version> (fixed set, installed with the plugin)
managed-settings.json: present / missing (see Phase 0 — warning only, never blocks)
FIGMA_TOKEN env:       set / not set (only needed for /ingest-figma)
```

## Phase 3 — Repair (user runs the commands)

Do not install anything. Print the exact commands for the user to run in a separate shell:

```
# Chrome DevTools MCP — already declared in .mcp.json (pinned, --isolated); approve it when Claude Code asks,
# or register it manually with the same pinned, isolated form:
claude mcp add chrome-devtools -s project -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@1.9.0 --isolated
brew install monolith
npm install -D pptxgenjs@4.0.1 puppeteer@24.41.0
```

Then ask them to restart Claude Code and re-run `/doctor`.

The only repair this skill performs itself: `Bash(mkdir -p artifacts assets/thumbs test)`.

## Phase 4 — Smoke test

Run it whenever Chrome DevTools MCP is connected; the optional dependencies (monolith, puppeteer, pptxgenjs) are not needed for the smoke deck, so a missing export dependency does not skip this phase.
1. `test/smoke-deck.html` is versioned in the repo. Only if `Bash(ls test/smoke-deck.html)` reports it missing, write this minimal one:
   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html><head><meta charset="utf-8"/><title>Smoke</title>
   <script src="../starters/deck_stage.js"></script></head>
   <body><deck-stage width="1920" height="1080">
     <section style="padding:60px;font:48px/1.2 Georgia"><h1>One</h1></section>
     <section style="padding:60px;font:48px/1.2 Georgia;background:#f4e4d7"><h1>Two</h1></section>
     <section style="padding:60px;font:48px/1.2 Georgia;background:#4a5d2e;color:#fff"><h1>Three</h1></section>
   </deck-stage></body></html>
   ```
2. Run `/done test/smoke-deck.html`
3. If Chrome DevTools MCP is connected — check screenshot at `.claude/last-preview.png` exists and console is clean
4. Report pass/fail

## Phase 5 — Hint sheet
